    "Miscellaneous Manufacturing": "Industries in the Miscellaneous Manufacturing subsector make a wide range of products that cannot readily be classified in specific NAICS subsectors in manufacturing.  Processes used by these establishments vary significantly, both among and within industries.  For example, a variety of manufacturing processes are used in manufacturing sporting and athletic goods that include products such as tennis rackets and golf balls.  The processes for these products differ from each other, and the processes differ significantly from the fabrication processes used in making dolls or toys, the melting and shaping of precious metals to make jewelry, and the bending, forming, and assembly used in making medical products.\n\nThe industries in this subsector are defined by what is made rather than how it is made.  Although individual establishments might be appropriately classified elsewhere in the NAICS structure, for historical continuity, these product-based industries were maintained.  In most cases, no one process or material predominates for an industry.\n\nEstablishments in this subsector manufacture products as diverse as medical equipment and supplies, jewelry, sporting goods, toys, and office supplies.\n",
    "Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing": "Industries in the Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing subsector transform metal into intermediate or end products, other than machinery, computers and electronics, and metal furniture, or treat metals and metal formed products fabricated elsewhere.  Important fabricated metal processes are forging, stamping, bending, forming, and machining, used to shape individual pieces of metal; and other processes, such as welding and assembling, used to join separate parts together.  Establishments in this subsector may use one of these processes or a combination of these processes.\n\nThe NAICS structure for this subsector distinguishes the forging and stamping processes in a single industry.  The remaining industries in the subsector group establishments based on similar combinations of processes used to make products.\n\nThe manufacturing performed in the Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing subsector begins with manufactured metal shapes.  The establishments in this subsector further fabricate the purchased metal shapes into a product.  For instance, the Spring and Wire Product Manufacturing industry starts with wire and fabricates such items.\n\nWithin the Manufacturing sector there are other establishments that make the same products made by this subsector; only these establishments begin production further back in the production process.  These establishments have a more integrated operation.  For instance, one establishment may manufacture steel, draw it into wire, and make wire products in the same establishment.  Such operations are classified in the Primary Metal Manufacturing subsector.\n",
    "Apparel Manufacturing": "Industries in the Apparel Manufacturing subsector group establishments with two distinct manufacturing processes: (1) cut and sew (i.e., purchasing fabric and cutting and sewing to make a garment) and (2) the manufacture of garments in establishments that first knit fabric and then cut and sew the fabric into a garment.  The Apparel Manufacturing subsector includes a diverse range of establishments manufacturing full lines of ready-to-wear apparel and custom apparel: apparel contractors, performing cutting or sewing operations on materials owned by others; jobbers, performing entrepreneurial functions involved in apparel manufacturing; and tailors, manufacturing custom garments for individual clients.  Knitting fabric, when done alone, is classified in the Textile Mills subsector, but when knitting is combined with the production of complete garments, the activity is classified in the Apparel Manufacturing subsector.\n",
    "Support Activities for Mining": "Industries in the Support Activities for Mining subsector group establishments primarily providing support services, on a contract or fee basis (except geophysical surveying and mapping, mine site preparation, construction, and transportation activities), required for the mining and quarrying of minerals and for the extraction of oil and gas.  Establishments performing exploration for minerals, on a contract or fee basis, are included in this subsector.  Exploration services include traditional prospecting methods, such as taking core samples and making geological observations at prospective sites.\n\nThe activities performed on a contract or fee basis by establishments in the Support Activities for Mining subsector are also often performed in-house by mining operators.  These activities include taking core samples, making geological observations at prospective sites, excavating slush pits and cellars, and such oil and gas operations as spudding in, drilling in, redrilling, directional drilling, and well surveying; running, cutting, and pulling casings, tubes, and rods; cementing and shooting wells; perforating well casings; acidizing and chemically treating wells; cleaning out, bailing, and swabbing wells; and operating oil and gas field gathering lines.\n\nEstablishments primarily engaged in providing site preparation and related construction activities on a contract or fee basis are classified in Sector 23, Construction.

When publishing and printing are done in the same establishment, the establishment is classified in Subsector 513, Publishing Industries, in the appropriate NAICS industry even if the receipts for printing exceed those for publishing.\n\nThis subsector includes printing on clothing because the production process for that activity is printing, not clothing manufacturing.  For instance, the printing of T-shirts is included in this subsector.  In contrast, printing on fabric (or grey goods) is not included.  This activity is part of the process of finishing the fabric and is included in Industry 31331, Textile and Fabric Finishing Mills.\n\nExcluded from this subsector are establishment primarily engaged in manufacturing bare printed circuit boards.  These establishments print, perforate, plate, screen, etch, or photoprint interconnecting pathways for electric current on laminates and are classified in Industry 33441, Semiconductor and Other Electronic Component Manufacturing.  Establishments primarily providing printing brokerage services are classified in Industry 56199, All Other Support Services.\n",

The further manufacturing may be performed in the same establishment and classified in this subsector, or it may be performed at a separate establishment and be classified elsewhere in the Manufacturing sector.\n\nThe main processes in this subsector include preparation and spinning of fiber, knitting or weaving of fabric, and the finishing of the textile.  The NAICS structure follows and captures this process flow.  Major industries in this flow, such as preparation of fibers, weaving of fabric, knitting of fabric, and fiber and fabric finishing, are uniquely identified.  Texturizing, throwing, twisting, and winding of yarn contain aspects of both fiber preparation and fiber finishing and are classified with preparation of fibers rather than with finishing of fibers.\n\nNAICS separates the manufacturing of primary textiles and the manufacturing of textile products (except apparel) produced from purchased primary textiles, such as fabric.  The manufacturing of textile products (except apparel) from purchased fabric is classified in Subsector 314, Textile Product Mills, and apparel from purchased fabric is classified in Subsector 315, Apparel Manufacturing.\n\nExcluded from this subsector are establishments that weave or knit fabric and make garments.

    "Performing Arts, Spectator Sports, and Related Industries": "Industries in the Performing Arts, Spectator Sports, and Related Industries subsector group establishments that produce or organize and promote live presentations involving the performances of actors and actresses, singers, dancers, musical groups and artists, athletes, and other entertainers, including independent (i.e., freelance) entertainers and the establishments that manage their careers.  The classification recognizes four basic processes: (1) producing (i.e., presenting) events; (2) organizing, managing, and/or promoting events; (3) managing and representing entertainers; and (4) providing the artistic, creative, and technical skills necessary to the production of these live events.  Also, this subsector contains four industries for performing arts companies.  Each is defined on the basis of the particular skills of the entertainers involved in the presentations.\n\nThe industry structure for this subsector makes a clear distinction between performing arts companies and performing artists (i.e., independent or freelance).  Although not unique to arts and entertainment, freelancing is a particularly important phenomenon in this Performing Arts, Spectator Sports, and Related Industries subsector.  Distinguishing this activity from the production activity is a meaningful process differentiation.  This approach, however, is difficult to implement in the case of musical groups (i.e., companies) and artists.  These establishments tend to be more loosely organized and it can be difficult to distinguish companies from freelancers.  For this reason, NAICS includes one industry that covers both musical groups and musical artists.\n\nThis subsector contains two industries for Industry Group 7113, Promoters of Performing Arts, Sports, and Similar Events, one for those that operate facilities and another for those that do not.  This is because there are significant differences in cost structures between those promoters that manage and provide the staff to operate facilities and those that do not.  In addition to promoters without facilities, other industries in this subsector include establishments that may operate without permanent facilities.  These types of establishments include performing arts companies; musical groups and artists; spectator sports; and independent (i.e., freelance) artists, writers, and performers.\n\nExcluded from this subsector are nightclubs.  Some nightclubs promote live entertainment on a regular basis and it can be argued that they could be classified in Industry Group 7113, Promoters of Performing Arts, Sports, and Similar Events.  However, since most of these establishments function as any other drinking place when they do not promote entertainment and because most of their revenue is derived from sale of food and beverages, they are classified in Subsector 722, Food Services and Drinking Places.\n",

    "Furniture and Related Product Manufacturing": "Industries in the Furniture and Related Product Manufacturing subsector make furniture and related articles, such as mattresses, window blinds, cabinets, and fixtures.  The processes used in the manufacture of furniture include the cutting, bending, molding, laminating, and assembly of such materials as wood, metal, glass, plastics, and rattan.  However, the production process for furniture is not solely bending metal, cutting and shaping wood, or extruding and molding plastics.  Design and fashion trends play an important part in the production of furniture.  The integrated design of the article for both esthetic and functional qualities is also a major part of the process of manufacturing furniture.  Design services may be performed by the furniture establishment's work force or may be purchased from industrial designers.\n\nFurniture may be made of any material, but the most common ones used in North America are metal and wood.  Furniture manufacturing establishments may specialize in making articles primarily from one material.  Some of the equipment required to make a wooden table, for example, is different from that used to make a metal one.  However, furniture is usually made from several materials.  A wooden table might have metal brackets, and a wooden chair a fabric or plastics seat.  Therefore, in NAICS, furniture initially is classified based on the type of furniture (application for which it is designed) rather than the material used.  For example, an upholstered sofa is treated as household furniture, although it may also be used in hotels or offices.\n\nWhen classifying furniture according to the component material from which it is made, furniture made from more than one material is classified based on the material used in the frame, or if there is no frame, the predominant component material.  Upholstered household furniture (excluding kitchen and dining room chairs with upholstered seats) is classified without regard to the frame material.  Kitchen or dining room chairs with upholstered seats are classified according to the frame material.\n\nFurniture may be made on a stock or custom basis and may be shipped assembled or unassembled (i.e., knockdown).  The manufacture of furniture parts and frames is included in this subsector.\n\nSome of the processes used in furniture manufacturing are similar to processes that are used in other segments of manufacturing.  For example, cutting and assembly occurs in the production of wood trusses that are classified in Subsector 321, Wood Product Manufacturing.  However, the multiple processes that distinguish wood furniture manufacturing from wood product manufacturing warrant inclusion of wooden furniture manufacturing in the Furniture and Related Product Manufacturing subsector.  Metal furniture manufacturing uses techniques that are also employed in the manufacturing of roll formed products classified in Subsector 332, Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing.  The molding process for plastics furniture is similar to the molding of other plastics products.  However, plastics furniture producing establishments tend to specialize in furniture.\n\nNAICS attempts to keep furniture manufacturing together, but there are notable exceptions: concrete, ceramic, or stone furniture; seating for transportation equipment; and specialized hospital furniture (e.g., hospital beds and operating tables).  These are classified in Subsector 327, Nonmetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing; Subsector 336, Transportation Equipment Manufacturing; and Subsector 339, Miscellaneous Manufacturing, respectively.\n",

    "Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction": "The Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction subsector comprises establishments whose primary activity is the construction of entire engineering projects (e.g., highways and dams), and specialty trade contractors, whose primary activity is the production of a specific component for such projects.  Specialty trade contractors in the Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction subsector generally are performing activities that are specific to heavy and civil engineering construction projects and are not normally performed on buildings.  The work performed may include new work, additions, alterations, or maintenance and repairs. \n\nSpecialty trade activities are classified in this subsector if the skills and equipment present are specific to heavy or civil engineering construction projects.  For example, specialized equipment is needed to paint lines on highways.  This equipment is not normally used in building applications so the activity is classified in this subsector.  Traffic signal installation, while specific to highways, uses much of the same skills and equipment that are needed for electrical work in building projects and is therefore classified in Subsector 238, Specialty Trade Contractors.\n\nConstruction projects involving water resources (e.g., dredging and land drainage) and projects involving open space improvement (e.g., parks and trails) are included in this subsector.  Establishments whose primary activity is the subdivision of land into individual building lots usually perform various additional site-improvement activities (e.g., road building and utility line installation) and are included in this subsector. \n\nEstablishments in this subsector are classified based on the types of structures that they construct.  This classification reflects variations in the requirements of the underlying production processes.\n",
    "Petroleum and Coal Products Manufacturing": "The Petroleum and Coal Products Manufacturing subsector is based on the transformation of crude petroleum and coal into usable products.  The dominant process is petroleum refining that involves the separation of crude petroleum into component products through such techniques as cracking and distillation.\n\nIn addition, this subsector includes establishments that primarily further process refined petroleum and coal products and produce products, such as asphalt coatings and petroleum lubricating oils.  However, establishments that manufacture petrochemicals from refined petroleum are classified in Industry 32511, Petrochemical Manufacturing.\n",
    "Textile Product Mills": "Industries in the Textile Product Mills subsector group establishments that make textile products (except apparel).  With a few exceptions, processes used by these establishments are generally cut and sew (i.e., purchasing fabric and cutting and sewing to make nonapparel textile products, such as sheets and towels).\n",
    "Specialty Trade Contractors": "The Specialty Trade Contractors subsector comprises establishments whose primary activity is performing specific activities (e.g., pouring concrete, site preparation, plumbing, painting, and electrical work) involved in building construction or other activities that are similar for all types of construction, but that are not responsible for the entire project.  The work performed may include new work, additions, alterations, maintenance, and repairs.  The production work performed by establishments in this subsector is usually subcontracted from establishments of the general contractor type or for-sale builders, but especially in remodeling and repair construction, work also may be done directly for the owner of the property.  Specialty trade contractors usually perform most of their work at the construction site, although they may have shops where they perform prefabrication and other work.  Establishments primarily engaged in preparing sites for new construction are also included in this subsector.\n\nThere are substantial differences in types of equipment, work force skills, and other inputs required by specialty trade contractors.  Establishments in this subsector are classified based on the underlying production function for the specialty trade in which they specialize.  Throughout the Specialty Trade Contractors subsector, establishments commonly provide both the parts and labor required to complete work.  For example, electrical contractors supply the current-carrying and noncurrent-carrying wiring devices that are required to install a circuit.  Plumbing, heating, and air-conditioning contractors also supply the parts required to complete a contract. \n\nEstablishments that specialize in activities primarily related to heavy and civil engineering construction that are not normally performed on buildings, such as the painting of lines on highways, are classified in Subsector 237, Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction.\n\nEstablishments that are primarily engaged in selling construction materials are classified in Sector 42, Wholesale Trade, or Sector 44-45, Retail Trade, based on the characteristics of the selling unit.\n",
    "Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing": "Industries in the Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing subsector make goods by processing plastics materials and raw rubber.  The core technology employed by establishments in this subsector is that of plastics or rubber product production.  Plastics and rubber are combined in the same subsector because plastics are increasingly being used as a substitute for rubber; however, the subsector is generally restricted to the production of products made of just one material, either solely plastics or rubber.\n\nMany manufacturing activities use plastics or rubber, for example the manufacture of footwear or furniture.  Typically, the production process of these products involves more than one material.  In these cases, technologies that allow disparate materials to be formed and combined are of central importance in describing the manufacturing activity.  In NAICS, such activities (footwear and furniture manufacturing) are not classified in the Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing subsector because the core technologies for these activities are diverse and involve multiple materials.\n\nWithin the Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing subsector, a distinction is made between plastics and rubber products at the industry group level, although it is not a rigid distinction, as can be seen from the definition of Industry 32622, Rubber and Plastics Hoses and Belting Manufacturing.  In the case of hoses and belting, plastics are used as a substitute for rubber, and the distinction in materials is not useful as a basis for establishment classification.\n\nIn keeping with the core technology focus of plastics, lamination of plastics film to plastics film as well as the production of bags from plastics only is classified in this subsector.  Lamination and bag production involving plastics and materials other than plastics are classified in Subsector 322, Paper Manufacturing.\n",
    "Monetary Authorities-Central Bank": "The Monetary Authorities-Central Bank subsector groups establishments that engage in performing central banking functions, such as issuing currency, managing the Nation's money supply and international reserves, holding deposits that represent the reserves of other banks and other central banks, and acting as a fiscal agent for the central government.\n",

    "Blank cheque issued pursuant to agreement": "A blank cheque issued pursuant to an agreement indicates a high level of trust, where the recipient is authorized to fill out the amount, typically within agreed limits, at a later date.",
    "Nonmetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing": "The Nonmetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing subsector is based on the transformation of mined or quarried nonmetallic minerals, such as sand, gravel, stone, clay, and refractory materials, into products for intermediate or final consumption.  Processes used include grinding, mixing, cutting, shaping, and honing.  Heat often is used in the process and chemicals are frequently mixed to change the composition, purity, and chemical properties for the intended product.  For example, glass is produced by heating silica sand to the melting point (sometimes combined with cullet or recycled glass) and then drawn, floated, or blow molded to the desired shape or thickness.  Refractory materials are heated and then formed into bricks or other shapes for use in industrial applications.\n\nThe Nonmetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing subsector includes establishments that manufacture bricks, refractories, ceramic products, and glass and glass products, such as plate glass and containers.  Also included are cement and concrete products, lime, gypsum, and other nonmetallic mineral products including abrasive products, ceramic plumbing fixtures, statuary, cut stone products, and mineral wool.  The products are used in a wide range of activities from construction and heavy and light manufacturing to articles for personal use.\n\nMining, beneficiating, and manufacturing activities often occur in a single location.  Separate receipts will be collected for these activities whenever possible.  When receipts cannot be broken out between mining and manufacturing, establishments that mine or quarry nonmetallic minerals, beneficiate the nonmetallic minerals, and further process the nonmetallic minerals into a more finished manufactured product are classified based on the primary activity of the establishment.  A mine that manufactures a small amount of finished products is classified in Sector 21, Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction.  An establishment that mines whose primary output is a more finished manufactured product is classified in the Manufacturing sector.\n\nExcluded from the Nonmetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing subsector are establishments that primarily beneficiate mined nonmetallic minerals.  Beneficiation is the process whereby the extracted material is reduced to particles that can be separated into mineral and waste, the former suitable for further processing or direct use.  Beneficiation establishments are included in Sector 21, Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction.\n",

This subsector includes a wide array of establishments, including air traffic control services, marine cargo handling, and motor vehicle towing.\n\nThe Support Activities for Transportation subsector includes services to transportation, separated by type of mode serviced.  The Support Activities for Rail Transportation industry includes services to the rail industry (e.g., railroad switching and terminal establishments).  Ship repair and maintenance services not done in a shipyard are included in the Other Support Activities for Water Transportation industry.  An example would be floating drydock services in a harbor.\n\nExcluded from this subsector are establishments primarily engaged in providing factory conversion and overhaul of transportation equipment, which are classified in Subsector 336, Transportation Equipment Manufacturing.  Establishments primarily engaged in providing rental and leasing of transportation equipment without operator are classified in Subsector 532, Rental and Leasing Services. Also, establishments primarily engaged in providing travel arrangement and reservation services are classified in Industry Group 5615, Travel Arrangement and Reservation Services.\n",

    "Cheque Overpayment": "The sum in the cheque is higher than the amount that was due to the appellant.",
    "Paper Manufacturing": "Industries in the Paper Manufacturing subsector make pulp, paper, or converted paper products.  The manufacturing of these products is grouped together because they constitute a series of vertically connected processes.  More than one is often carried out in a single establishment.  There are essentially three activities.  The manufacturing of pulp involves separating the cellulose fibers from other impurities in wood or used paper.  The manufacturing of paper involves matting these fibers into a sheet.  The manufacturing of converted paper products involves converting paper and other materials by various cutting and shaping techniques and includes coating and laminating activities.\n\nThe Paper Manufacturing subsector is subdivided into two industry groups, the first for the manufacturing of pulp and paper and the second for the manufacturing of converted paper products.  Paper making is treated as the core activity of the subsector.  Therefore, any establishment that makes paper (including paperboard), either alone or in combination with pulp manufacturing or paper converting, is classified as a paper or paperboard mill.  Establishments that make pulp without making paper are classified as pulp mills.  Pulp mills, paper mills, and paperboard mills comprise the first industry group.\n\nEstablishments that make products from purchased paper and other materials make up the second industry group, Converted Paper Product Manufacturing.  This general activity is then subdivided based, for the most part, on process distinctions.  Paperboard container manufacturing uses corrugating, cutting, and shaping machinery to form paperboard into containers.  Paper bag and coated and treated paper manufacturing establishments cut and coat paper and foil.  Stationery product manufacturing establishments make a variety of paper products used for writing, filing, and similar applications.  Other converted paper product manufacturing includes, in particular, the conversion of sanitary paper stock into such things as tissue paper and disposable diapers.\n\nAn important process used in the Paper Bag and Coated and Treated Paper Manufacturing industry is lamination, often combined with coating.  Lamination and coating make a composite material with improved properties of strength, impermeability, and so on.  The laminated materials may be paper, metal foil, or plastics film.  While paper is often one of the components, it is not always.  Lamination of plastics film to plastics film is classified in Subsector 326, Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing, because establishments that do this often first make the film.  The same situation holds with respect to bags.  The manufacturing of bags from plastics only, whether or not laminated, is classified in Subsector 326, Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing.\n\nExcluded from this subsector are photosensitive papers.  These papers are chemically treated and are classified in Industry 32599, All Other Chemical Product and Preparation Manufacturing.\n",
    "Couriers and Messengers": "Industries in the Couriers and Messengers subsector provide intercity, local, and/or international delivery of parcels and documents (including express delivery services) without operating under a universal service obligation.  These articles may originate in the U.S. but be delivered to another country and can be described as those that may be handled by one person without using special equipment.  This allows the collection, pick-up, and delivery operations to be done with limited labor costs and minimal equipment.  Sorting and transportation activities, where necessary, are generally mechanized.  The restriction to small parcels partly distinguishes these establishments from those in the transportation industries.  The complete network of courier services establishments also distinguishes these transportation services from local messenger and delivery establishments in this subsector.  This includes the establishments that perform intercity transportation as well as establishments that, under contract to them, perform local pick-up and delivery.  Messengers, which usually deliver within a metropolitan or single urban area, may use bicycle, foot, car, small truck, or van.\n",

    "Capitation Fee Payments by Cheque": "Cheque issued towards capitation fee typically relates to education, where it's used to pay a fixed fee for a student's admission to an educational institution.",
    "Beverage and Tobacco Product Manufacturing": "Industries in the Beverage and Tobacco Product Manufacturing subsector manufacture beverages and tobacco products.  The Beverage Manufacturing industry group includes three types of establishments: (1) those that manufacture nonalcoholic beverages; (2) those that manufacture alcoholic beverages through the fermentation process; and (3) those that produce distilled alcoholic beverages.  Ice manufacturing, while not a beverage, is included with nonalcoholic beverage manufacturing because it uses the same production process as water purification.\n\nIn the case of activities related to the manufacture of beverages, the structure follows the defined production processes.  Brandy, a distilled beverage, is not placed under distillery product manufacturing, but rather under winery product manufacturing since the production process used in the manufacturing of alcoholic grape-based beverages produces both wines (fermented beverage) and brandies (distilled beverage).\n\nThe Tobacco Manufacturing industry group includes two types of establishments: (1) those engaged in redrying and stemming tobacco and (2) those that manufacture tobacco products, such as cigarettes and cigars.\n",
    "Check Transaction Successful": "Transaction completed successfully.",
    "Leather and Allied Product Manufacturing": "Establishments in the Leather and Allied Product Manufacturing subsector transform hides into leather by tanning or curing and fabricating the leather into products for final consumption.  This subsector also includes the manufacture of similar products from other materials, including products (except apparel) made from \"leather substitutes,\" such as rubber, plastics, or textiles.  Rubber footwear, textile luggage, and plastics purses or wallets are examples of \"leather substitute\" products included in this subsector.  The products made from leather substitutes are included in this subsector because they are made in similar ways leather products are made (e.g., luggage).  They are made in the same establishments, so it is not practical to separate them.\n\nThe inclusion of leather and hide tanning and finishing in this subsector is partly because it is a relatively small industry that has few close neighbors as a production process, partly because leather is an input to some of the other products classified in this subsector, and partly for historical reasons.\n",
    "Consideration Presumption": "Assumes that all negotiable instruments are created for a valid consideration.",
